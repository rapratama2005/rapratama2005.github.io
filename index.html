            <p>So, it's finally here. Winter break. I'll be honest it did not feel like an entire semester but that could be a product just how fast time flies. 
                <br> <br>While we're here, it might be a good idea to reflect about this semester, all of it's ups and downs. 
                <br> <br>On the downside: OH GOD THAT'S A LOT OF WORK FROM TWO AP CLASSES (APCSA is easy). 
                <br>On the upside: Video Game playtime has gone down, Guitar time went up, and I am now Underclassmen Representative of the CS Club and Vice President of the Robotics Team.
                <br> <br>Overall, probably a net positive. Now, what are the plans for next semester?
                <br> <br>I want to get better on one-on-one conversations. I don't think I'm particulary good at that, and I need to be more social. I'll probably go to more CS and Robotics competitions. There's a good chance that I'm running for an NHS officer position, because why not?
